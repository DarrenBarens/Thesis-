# Thesis- Define key features impact realism of computer-generated influencers (CGI) for machine
Description
Project one: Classification. Set CNN model on CelebA and ImageNet dateset to train model to be able to detect human face for next project. Reduce data bias by applying variational autoencoder to the model.
Result: Filter influencers data set only included human faces.
Project two: Machine learning image transfer with GAN(DC GAN)
Result: Generating new virtual images data set.
Project three: Tuning parameters of the DC GAN generator and discriminator models to define the key parameters to improve the image quality.

Objective
Build a Machine Learning Model to generate higher quality face pictures.
Requirements
Jupyter Notebooks with Python 3.7 +
Library needed pandas ,numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn.preprocessing,. sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.tree, sklearn.ensemble, xgboost, sklearn.metrics, warnings.
